## About

This blog is a dump of my thoughts, notes and essays - some will not make sense, and typos will be plenty. I got sick and tired of organizing my huge library of Emacs-org notes and wanted to share some of them. This is my humble attempt - if you find it useful, then my work here is done.

I do data, I do software, I do open-source. I do Linux networking, hack embedded devices and tame "big data". I also write software for mobiles (Android, Blackberry and iPhone).

One thing I do very well is SHIP PRODUCT. I got so good at cleaning up other people's mess I formed a company [PigStyCoders](http://pigstycoders.com). I don't do well with theories and think abstraction for abstraction sake is silly. I don't have a Computing science degree so please don't ask me about funky algorithms. 

I love challenges, so please email me with your real-world software problems and I will try to fix it.

In my past life I used to work with software in high performance cars [here](http://www.astonmartin.com/), [here](http://www.jaguar.com/gb/en/) and [here](http://www.bmw.com/), racing cars [here](http://www.mclaren.com/home/), regular cars [here](http://www.ford.co.uk/). 

I then decided to do something totally different [Computational Finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance), realised that most of it was *NOT* based on empirical data, so decided to fund my own research into analysing risk - similar in vein to [Mandelbroit](http://www.amazon.com/The-behavior-Markets-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0465043550). 

As an open source evangelist, I practise what I preach and currently helping to build soon-to-be one of Africa's largest broadband network [ClubNetWifi](http://www.clubnetwifi.com). This will use 100% open-source components, both hardware and software.

Drop me a line if you want to chat... oh but I don't make contacting me obvious.
